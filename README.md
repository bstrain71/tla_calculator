TLA Calculation Instruction: https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/Docs/perdiem/Computing_TLA.pdf

This application lets users calculate Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA) in accordance with the Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) instruction. TLA can be complex to calculate and it varies depending on the number of dependents who are present, access to cooking/kitchen facilities, and location. This app simplifies the process and is updated prior to the end of each month with DTMO published per diem rates, which can be accessed here.

This app is not an official government app. If you are calculating TLA for you and your family consult your local Personnel Support Detachment or Administrative Chain of Command.
