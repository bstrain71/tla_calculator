## TLA Calculator

The app can be accessed here: https://bstrain71.shinyapps.io/oconus_tla_calculator/

This application lets users calculate Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA) in accordance with the Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) instruction found here: https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/Docs/perdiem/Computing_TLA.pdf

TLA can be complex to calculate and it varies depending on the number of dependents who are present, access to cooking/kitchen facilities, and location. This app simplifies the process and is updated prior to the end of each month with DTMO published per diem rates, which can be accessed here: https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/perdiemCalc.cfm
